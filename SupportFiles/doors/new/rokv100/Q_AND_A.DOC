   Here are some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) that will hopefully
   solve some problems that you may be experiencing with Realm of Kisom.

   Question: "When a user tries to access ROK on my BBS, it doesn't do
             anything, and simply returns them to the BBS!"

   Answer  : This is most likely caused by your ROK Batch file not executing
             ROK properly.   See the above section for information on how to
             setup your batch file.

             {*} NOTE - ROK *might* not be getting enough Memory!  Here's a
                        way to check if this is the problem: If, in the ROK
                        batch file, you have "@ECHO OFF", delete that, then
                        run ROK again. It should know show you what's going
                        on when it tries to execute ROK from your BBS.  See
                        where it executes the command line - and if it says
                        something like: "Not enough memory to run program",
                        then that's the problem!  :-)  If you are unsure of
                        just how much Memory your BBS takes up, run MEM.EXE
                        in the batch file and see.   Then, consult your BBS
                        Documentation for info on reducing memory usage. It
                        should then work for you.   ROK automatically loads
                        most of it's files into EMS, if it's available.

   Question: "ROK has the OnNow flag ON for a user who isn't even in the
             game!  Another user enters, challenges that person, and ROK
             screws up there!  Help!"

   Answer  : This error is caused by an Abnormal Exit from the game.  Either
             ROK had an error, a lock-up, power failure, etc.  This does not
             happen when a user drops carrier, though, ROK is smart that way.

             For Single-Line BBS's, the solution is *very* simple.  Run
             NOW_OFF.EXE in the batch file that runs ROK (explained above).
             This will turn the OnNow flag off for every user *before* a
             user enters the game.

             For Multi-Node BBS's, this is the fix.  You can run NOW_OFF.EXE
             if you wish.   However, a more important step is to notify your
             users that after seven seconds of no response from the other end
             of the online duel, a player can choose to leave the fight.

             What the heck am I talking about?  Here's an example to help:

             Player A has had an abnormal exit from the game.  The OnNow flag
             for this character has remained "ON".  Player B enters the game,
             sees that Player A is online, and challenges that player.  After
             seven seconds of Player A not responding in the fight - Player B
             can choose to leave it.  It's very simple!   After this Player A
             doesn't respond, Player B should know that Player A isn't really
             online.

             Hope that explains it! :-)

   Question: "Why the heck are there so many MSG*_*.DAT files?"

   Answer  : Those are Message Data Files.  They're mail waiting to be read
             by certain players.

   Question: "I cannot figure out how to pass the correct Node Number to the
             batch file ROK command line!  Help!"

   Answer  : Each BBS Software is different.  Almost all of them use a symbol
             to represent a Node Number.    You will have to consult your BBS
             Software Documentation to see how to do it.  Sorry I can't be of
             any more assistance in this area.

   Question: "ROK locks up at the Introduction ANSI/RIP Screen!"

   Answer  : Well, I don't have a clue why this should happen.  If this is a
             persistant error, there is a Toggle to disable showing it. It's
             in ROKCFG.EXE's (M)iscellaneous Maintenance Menu. Simply Toggle
             it to OFF, and you should have no more problems.

             {*} NOTE - You can experiment with the three different FOSSIL
                        Driver types (explained above), that may cause the
                        Into ANSI/RIP lockups to go away.

   Question: "A player was able to marry someone who wasn't even in the game!"

   Answer  : In ROKCFG.EXE's (M)iscellaneous Maintenance Menu, there is an
             option to Divorce *ALL* Married Players in the Realm.  If this
             error should ever happen, simply run this option, and everything
             should be fine.

   Question: "My registration code doesn't work!  Help me out, please!"

   Answer  : Extensive testing has been done to ensure that your registration
             code *should* work.  However, if it does not, DON'T PANIC! :-)

             Simply contact the me, and I'd be more than happy to help you out
             with this problem. Ways of contacting me are given on Page 8 of
             the ROK Documentation (ROK.DOC).

   Question: "I don't know how to change my US funds into Canadian Funds!"

   Answer  : Don't bother!  I accept BOTH Canadian AND US Funds in registration
             forms!

   Question: "I use DORINFO1.DEF as my dropfile.  I use it to run all my
             nodes.  ROK doesn't recognize that it's supposed to be Node #2
             with a DORINFO1.DEF file!  Help!"

   Answer  : Most BBS Softwares that support DORINFO also support DOOR.SYS.
             If your BBS Supports both of these, try changing it to DOOR.SYS.
             If not, then run ROK with this command line:

             ROK.EXE * /P<pathtodropfile>

             Where "*" is the node number, /P<pathtodropfile> tells ROK where
             to look for the DropFile.  It does not matter if this path has the
             trailing backslash ("\") or not.

             I think that should work, hopefully.

   Question: "I want to run Maintenance today - again!"

   Answer  : Simply delete TIME.DAT from your ROK Directory.  The next time
             ROK is ran, Maintenance will execute again.

   Question: "I have a bug report that isn't addressed anywhere in your ROK
             documentation!"

   Answer  : Fabulous!  Fill out BUGRPT.FRM.  Send this to me.  Ways of
             contacting me are given on Page 8 of the ROK Documentation.
	     *Please* be as clear as possible when explaining the report!
	     Also, please print, if you can, or write neatly! :)

   Question: "I'm stumped.  Nothing seems to work!"

   Answer  : Consult Page 7 in ROK.DOC.  There, it will give you the
             ROK Command Line Parameters.  This, hopefully, will help you out.

   I hope I have covered most of the topics here.  If your question is not
   addressed, then feel free to contact me.  Ways of contacting me are given
   on Page 8 of the ROK Documentation (ROK.DOC).

   Alternatively, you may call my BBS - The Inner City BBS, at 1-306-694-5864.
   There is an entire message base setup for ROK alone (Msg.Area #4).  This is
   the area to discuss comments/suggestions on how to improve ROK, bug reports
   and more.  Almost everything is addressed in this area.

   Hopefully, soon, there will be a ROK Echo available on Plannet Connect.
   When it is available, I will hopefully be addressing messages in there.

   ** Hope that helps! **
